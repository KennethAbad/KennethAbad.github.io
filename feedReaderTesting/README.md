# Feed Reader Testing Portfolio Project

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The previous developer completed the web application, but did not finish testing. I had to write a number of tests to ensure that the application runs as intended. 
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is where developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Writing effective tests require analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

Whether you work in an organization that writes extensively to inform product development or one that uses tests to encourage iteration, testing has become an essential skill in modern web development!
